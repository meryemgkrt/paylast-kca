            <p>WHO IS GENERAL SUN TZU?</p>
            <H1>THE GREATEST MILITARY STRATEGIST</H1>
            <p>
                The oldest available sources disagree as to where Sun Tzu was born.
                The Spring and Autumn Annals and Sima Qian's later Records of the
                Grand Historian (Shiji) state that Sun Tzu was born in Qi. Both
                sources also agree that Sun Tzu was born in the late Spring and Autumn
                period and that he was active as a general and strategist, serving
                King Helü of Wu in the late sixth century BC, beginning around 512 BC.
                Sun Tzu's victories then inspired him to write The Art of War. The Art
                of War was one of the most widely read military treatises in the
                subsequent Warring States period, a time of constant war among seven
                ancient Chinese states–Zhao, Qi, Qin, Chu, Han, Wei, and Yan–who
                fought to control the vast expanse of fertile territory in
                <span>Eastern China.</span>
